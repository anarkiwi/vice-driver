"""Coverage harvester for live 6502/6510 execution under asid-vice.

Two coverage layers, selected by ``granularity`` at construction time:

1. ``"byte"`` (default) — one CHECK_EXEC checkpoint per byte in
   ``[start, end]``. ``hit_count`` per checkpoint is monotone and immune
   to cpuhistory ring-buffer rollover, so the snapshot diff directly
   yields *every PC that executed at least once*. Useful when a busy IRQ
   handler can otherwise evict interesting PCs from cpuhistory before a
   drain. Install is held under ``bm.halted()`` because each
   newly-installed watchpoint adds per-instruction comparison overhead
   to warp emulation between calls — auto-resumed installs are
   ``O(N²)``; the halted install path covers a full 45,000-byte range
   in ~11s.

2. ``"page"`` — one checkpoint per 256-byte page. Cheap (~200 ms
   install) but gives only page-level resolution; the per-PC question
   "which bytes in this page are code?" requires cpuhistory drains,
   which a busy IRQ can evict before drain.

The cpuhistory drain stays in ``measure()`` regardless of granularity;
its PC set is now secondary to ``executed_pcs`` (the byte-mode hits)
but the register values it captures are still useful for ad-hoc
investigation.
